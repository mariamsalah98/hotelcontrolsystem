# hotelcontrolsystem
In this project , we used the keil IDE  to implement 3 drivers the keypad driver , the UART driver and the GPI0 driver then we used this 3 drivers to design a control system for hotel rooms using the tiva c as the main building unit and based on the UART communication principles between the PC and the board ,as we are facing some difficulties in buying components due to  the corona virus I used the built in LED in port F as an indicator if the door is locked or not , the project consist of 3 modes , the setup mode, in which we enter all the room numbers that we have in the hotel , then when the user enter a room number in the next modes the system should be able to check if the room exists or not , the next mode is the check in mode if the user enters the room number and entered a status of 1 then the system would prompt the user to enter a password if the password entered  by  keypad is the same as this password then the door should unlock(LED on),the third mode is room service mode if the user entered a room number then entered status equals to 2 then the door should be unlocked automatically (LED on), the fourth mode is the checkout mode If the user entered a room number and entered a status of value 3 then the saved password should be cleared and the door should be locked(LED off).
